            <p>An Ionian of deep resolve, Yasuo is an agile swordsman who wields the air itself against his enemies.
                As a proud young man, he was falsely accused of murdering his master—unable to prove his innocence,
                he was forced to slay his own brother in self defense. Even after his master’s true killer was revealed,
                Yasuo still could not forgive himself for all he had done,
                and now wanders his homeland with only the wind to guide his blade.</p>

                <p>Alone against an army, Yasuo chose to stand and fight. He
                    blocked a narrow pass between two mountains, allowing innocents
                    to escape the bloodshed. Wielding the truth of steel as a dance,
                    he felled countless foes—but even he could not hold out forever.
                    The Dragon of Truth, moved by his swordsmanship, came down from
                    its peak to bless him...</p>

                    <h2>Spirit Blossom</h2>
                    <p>Long ago, two brothers fought a bitter war across Ionia.
                        Yasuo, the younger brother, was a warlord renowned for his
                        roguish demeanor—until he was accused of crimes against the
                        country and took up arms to defend himself. Both were fated
                        to fall in their final duel… a lesson, perhaps, in pride and hubris.</p>

                    <p>Yasuo returned from advanced combat only to be accused of a
                        crime he did not commit. Knowing that PROJECT's corporate
                        leadership was somehow involved, Yasuo fights with the G/NETIC
                        rebels, cutting away the lies of technology with his plasma coated blade.</p>

                    <p>Born from festering echoes at the dawn of creation, Yasuo is
                        the hellish embodiment of chaos in the cosmos. Fated to clash
                        against the Dawnbringer for all time, he awaits a day when
                        his darkness will finally cleave away her light.</p>
