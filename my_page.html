            <img src="image/main.jpg" alt="main picture">
            <p>An Ionian of deep resolve, Yasuo is an agile swordsman who wields the air itself against his enemies.
                As a proud young man, he was falsely accused of murdering his master—unable to prove his innocence,
                he was forced to slay his own brother in self defense. Even after his master’s true killer was revealed,
                Yasuo still could not forgive himself for all he had done,
                and now wanders his homeland with only the wind to guide his blade.<br>
                Even though Yasuo’s older half-brother, Yone, was everything Yasuo
                was not—respectful, cautious, conscientious—the two were inseparable.
                When other children teased Yasuo, Yone was there to defend him.
                But what Yasuo lacked in patience, he made up for in determination.
                When Yone began his apprenticeship at the village’s renowned sword school,
                a young Yasuo followed, waiting outside in monsoon rain, until the
                teachers relented and opened the gates.<br>
                When word of the Noxian invasion reached the school, some were
                inspired by the great stand that had been taken at the Placidium of Navori,
                and soon the village was bled of the able bodied. Yasuo longed to add his
                sword to the cause, but even as his classmates and brother left to fight,
                he was ordered to remain and protect the elders.</p>

                <p>Alone against an army, Yasuo chose to stand and fight. He
                    blocked a narrow pass between two mountains, allowing innocents
                    to escape the bloodshed. Wielding the truth of steel as a dance,
                    he felled countless foes—but even he could not hold out forever.
                    The Dragon of Truth, moved by his swordsmanship, came down from
                    its peak to bless him...</p>

                    <p>Long ago, two brothers fought a bitter war across Ionia.
                        Yasuo, the younger brother, was a warlord renowned for his
                        roguish demeanor—until he was accused of crimes against the
                        country and took up arms to defend himself. Both were fated
                        to fall in their final duel… a lesson, perhaps, in pride and hubris.</p>

                    <p>Yasuo returned from advanced combat only to be accused of a
                        crime he did not commit. Knowing that PROJECT's corporate
                        leadership was somehow involved, Yasuo fights with the G/NETIC
                        rebels, cutting away the lies of technology with his plasma coated blade.</p>

                    <p>Born from festering echoes at the dawn of creation, Yasuo is
                        the hellish embodiment of chaos in the cosmos. Fated to clash
                        against the Dawnbringer for all time, he awaits a day when
                        his darkness will finally cleave away her light.</p>
